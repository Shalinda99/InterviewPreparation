              <h2>What to Wear to an Interview: Female & Male </h2>
              <p>
              When preparing for an interview, dressing appropriately can significantly impact your first impression on potential employers. For females, a classic and professional look can be achieved with a tailored blouse or button-down shirt paired with a well-fitted skirt or trousers. Conservative colors and modest accessories are recommended, along with closed-toe shoes. For males, a smart suit in neutral colors, complemented by a crisp dress shirt and tie, exudes professionalism. Opting for polished shoes and minimal accessories completes the polished appearance.!
